## Required Libraries

This project uses the following external libraries in addition to the Python standard library:

* `aiohttp`: An asynchronous HTTP client/server framework used for making and handling HTTP requests.
* `fastapi`: A high-performance, web API framework built on Pydantic for developing robust and efficient APIs.
* `filelock`: A cross-platform file locking implementation used to ensure exclusive access to files when necessary.
* `sqlite3` (This should already be installed with most Python versions): A database extension module providing access to SQLite databases.
* `toml`: A parser and writer for the TOML file format, used for configuration files.
* `uvicorn`: An ASGI server for running Python web frameworks like FastAPI.

You can install them using pip:
